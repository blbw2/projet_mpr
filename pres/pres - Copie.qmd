# Introduction

## Green transition requires large-scale invesment

<!-- - de texte, gros chiffres de I4CE -->

- **How should we fund efforts towards decarbonisation, considering the scale of investments needed ? In practice, a mix of public policy providing funding and private financing.**

![](figures/i4ce_investneeds2.png)
<br>
Source: I4CE, *Panorama des financements climats 2025*
<!-- - In the case of housing energy efficiency, policy typically incentivises households (via grants, preferential loans/guarantees...) to carry out improvements. -->
<!--   - In Europe especially, White Certificate schemes impose targets on energy suppliers, in terms of energy efficiency gains (which they achieve by proving support to households themselves). -->
  
-  **What effects do public programmes have on private investments in decarbonisation ?**
  

## Dealing with negative externalities : taxing vs subsidising behaviours


```{r}
tribble(~"Pigovian-like Taxes", ~"Subsidies",
        "Theoretically most efficient, achieves input subtitution and output reduction", "Not optimal, requires (distortionary) revenue-raising",
        "Efficiency requires uniform pricing of externality","May be targeted to address various market failures",
        "Penalises inelastic consumers, arguably regressive impact", "Can be targeted to achieve redistribution, financing depends on overall progressive tax system",
        "", "In presence of market power, subsidies may be captured by firms rather than consumers"
        ) |> 
  gt()
```
Schematically, a carbon tax or energy consumption tax would be the economist's preferred policy, while subsidies can be justified on grounds of specific market failures and/or concerns over a tax's redistributive effects.

- In practice, both (and many other policies, e.g. regulatory standards) are widely used by governments.
  - Hence the interest in their **interaction**.
  
## Outline of the paper

- We am to answer the following question : 
  - **Does public funding via subsidies substitute for, or crowd in, private investment for decarbonisation ?**

- We study the effects of **public grants for home energy efficiency improvements**, in the context of a pre-existing scheme which sets **home energy savings targets for energy providers** (to be financed by passing on costs to bills).

- To do so, we rely on a increase in the amount of grants for home improvements that was decided in March 2022, effective mid-April 2022.
  - We study the effects of this increase using an event-study approach.

## Preview of the results
- **We find :**
  - **Minimal increase in the number of improvements** carried out ;
  - **Approx 1/3 of the increase in grants offset by lower contributions from energy providers** ;
  - **A majority of the increase in grants passed on to improvement prices.**
  - **No significant effect on household's improvement expenses, net of public+private support**.


# Policy context & data

## MaPrimeRenov' : progressive grants for house improvements

- MPR is a redesign of a previously existing tax credit scheme for improvements in domestic energy efficiency.
  - Policymakers aimed to address issues of additionality and redistribution. 

- **For any given house improvement, grants vary depending on the household's size and position relative to income quartiles**
<br>
![](figures/mpr_seuilsrevenus.png)

<!-- - Redesign of the *Crédit d'Impôt pour la Transition Energétique* (CITE) : notably, the tax credit nature of the CITE limited its reach/effectiveness, and raised concerns in terms of equity as it benefited mostly households well-off enough to use the tax credit. -->

<!-- - Lump-sum subsidy defined for various types of improvements. -->
<!--   - For each improvement type, the amount is modulated according to which income group the household belongs to. -->
<!--   - E.g. : 4000 euro grant for the installation of a new heat pump, for households in the first quartile of the income distribution (3000 euros for those in the second quartile). -->
  
- **2020 to March 2025 : 13.9 billion euros of grants**.
  - 2.1 billion in 2021, 3.1 in 2022.
  
- **MPR may be combined with other aids, up to a maximum of 90% of the price of the improvement**.
  
## Certificats d'Economies d'Energie : savings mandate financed by energy bills

- Energy providers are set targets in terms of energy savings ; targets are met by producing certificates of household energy savings. 
  - Households sign these in return for assistance in improving their homes' energy efficiency (financial and other).

![](figures/CEE_vec.png)

<!-- - The state mandates energy providers to help households achieve energy savings targets (expressed in kW/h cumac), over a multi-year period. -->
<!-- - Typically, energy providers will go out and seek potential beneficiairies, or mandate private intermediaries to do so. -->
<!-- - As proof of their contributions, energy suppliers ask households to sign a formal declaration recognising that the firm made a genuine/substantial contribution to their decision to invest in efficiency improvements. -->
<!--   - There is a list of standardised improvements with associated guidelines for financial support that can be expected of the energy companies. Ultimately, however, the delivery of certificates rests on households' signatures, though some controls are carried out (?). -->

- In practice, energy providers (or third parties) will seek out households which may be enticed into carrying out improvements, and thus delivering certificates.



## MPR & CEE design features :
  
**Two key aspects of MPR's design :**

<!-- revenir sur le mécanisme de crowding out classique -->


1. MPR subsidies are defined by administrative decrees, unlike CEE support which is left to the energy providers' discretion. [? confirmer --> attention coups de pouces = plancher]
  - Thus, MPR's design opens the door for strategic behaviours from energy providers, i.e., calibrating their CEE support to households according to the amount already covered by the State through MPR.
  
2. **The sum of MPR and CEE may not exceed a share of the total cost of the improvement (from 60% to 90%)**.
  - Depending on the generosity of MPR and CEE, this may "mechanically" introduce substitution effects between MPR and CEE.
  
  
# Data & descriptive statistics


## The MPR dataset

- The MPR dataset was compiled by the Transition Ministry's statistical service, based on the internal processing system for MPR applications.

<!-- - Base construite par le SDES : données extraites du traitement (? pas très précisé...) des dossiers MPR. -->

<!-- - A household applies for MPR : either for one specific improvement, or commonly for several works at once (e.g. installing a new water boiler while improving the isolation). -->

<!-- - Hence the dataset is split into 3 parts : -->

<!--   <!-- - Dossier : regroups information relative to the overall application. Personal details (adress, income), characteristics of the home (flat or house, energy performance certificates), number of improvements, total value of the improvements (and of any aid received : MPR, CEE, other). --> -->
<!--   <!-- - Geste : information specific to every single improvement : price, MPR/CEE/other aid received, and ID of the firm that carried out the improvement. --> -->
<!--   <!-- - CEE : information specific to every single improvement : CEE aid received, and ID. --> -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- tribble(~"Subdataset",~"Scope", ~"Variables", -->
<!--         "Dossier","Overall MPR application" ,"Personal details (address, income);\n Number of improvements ;\n Home characteristics (house/flat ; owner-occupied ; EPCs) ; Total value of all improvements & aid received (MPR/CEE/other)", -->
<!--         "Geste", "Single improvement", "Nature of improvement;\n Total value of the improvement & MPR aid received ;\n Contracting firm ID (SIREN+SIRET)", -->
<!--         "CEE", "Single improvement", "Total CEE aid received") |>  -->
<!--   gt() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Every dossier is given a specific ID number. For individual improvements, all 3 files can be linked via the combination of ID + type of improvement carried out + firm ID. -->

- From the original dataset, we retrieve some useful application-level information and link it back to records of individual improvements - each observation is thus an individual energy efficiency improvement.
  
- **We then aggregate the individual improvements in the MPR data into a panel dataset at the *Zone d'Emploi* level (285 total ZEs in metropolitan France) and at monthly frequency.**

## Sample & treated/control group selection

- At this stage, we focus on the lowest income category : i.e. those most likely to be "activated" by the subsidies, and for whom the MPR+CEE constraint is least likely to bind. 

- We focus on discrete improvements rather than insulation works, as the former make for more intuitive comparison groups.

<!-- [soit on justifie davantage en suivant cet argument, soit on élargit le champ de l'étude à toutes les catégories de revenus.] -->

- The treated group could include, in theory, all types of improvements which were concerned by the MPR increase of April 2022. 
  - Thus far : we focus on heat pumps as our treated group, which are the improvement type which 1) benefited from the MPR increase 2) has the highest number of observations.
  
- The control group includes improvements which were not concerned by the MPR increase.
  - **We further exclude high performance gas boilers due to the trend in gas prices and explicit policy of reducing their usage**.

<!-- [En pratique, on s'est limité pour l'instant aux PAC pour limiter le nombre d'estimations à faire/ c'est ce qui donne le groupe traité avec N le plus élevé..] -->

# Methodology

## Identification : a surprise announcement  following the invasion of Ukraine

We leverage an administrative decision, announced mid-March 2022, to increase the MPR subisidies for **some** types of improvements.

![](figures/pompili_tweet.png)

- The MPR increase was part of the French Government's Resilience strategy in the wake of the Russian invasion and subsequent energy shock.
  - The stated aim was to decrease French dependence on fossil fuels. (In fact, MPR grants for high-performance gas boilers was intended to be terminated immediately, though this was put off to 2023.)
  
## Grants were increased for some, but not all, eligible home improvements

- This non-exhaustive table shows the temporary increase in grants for some of the key improvement types.

        )
      )

```


## Estimation

- We examine the effects of the increase in MPR grants through an event-study framework.
  - Using an **estimator robust to heterogenenity in treatment effects (Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021)**, we study the effects of the MPR change 5 months before/after it was effective.
  
As our treatment variable is binary (= 1 if the improvement type is concerned by the MPR increase and the date is 15/04/2022 or after), the estimation is similar to, but more robust than, the canonical DiD TWFE regression :

$$Y_{i,t}=\alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{k = -5; }^{5} \gamma_k*D_{i,t-k} + \beta*X_{i,t}$$
  

- At this stage, **we are limited in terms of specification choice by the amount of variables available in the CASD dataset**. We control for :

  - Median fiscal revenue ;
  - Share of MPR applicants that are homeowners.
  
  
<!-- as well as the  to control for potential product differentiation and agent-principal issues. -->
<!-- <!-- [On pourrait ajouter les variables relatives aux DPE, si elles sont bien renseignées..

## Distribution des reste à charge vs seuil d'écrêtement

- Rappel : la somme des primes MPR + CEE ne peut pas dépasser 90% du prix TTC.
  <!-- - Pour les PAC, sur les 5 mois avant la modification de MPR, environ 30% des installations étaient à moins de 1000 euros du seuil. -->
  - **Sur la période pré-intervention, parmi les travaux où le cumul des aides impliquant un reste à charge <1000 euros, l'écart entre le seuil d'écrètement et le cumul des aides était de 349 euros en moyenne.**
