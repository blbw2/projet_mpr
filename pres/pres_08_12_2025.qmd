# Introduction 

<!-- ## Faced with increasing investment needs, fiscally constrained governments look to private financing  -->

<!-- - Governments (esp. in the EU) feel that fiscal sustainability is at risk, while investment needs grow larger. -->
<!-- <!-- [mettre côte-à-côte trajectoire reduction deficits + besoins investissements (cf CAE par ex) --> -->
<!-- <!-- alternativement, documents UE -> cf besoin de financement privé (qui viendraient de "channeling private savings")] --> -->

<!-- ![](figures/traj_RAA.png) -->

<!-- ## Decarbonisation plans are expected to rely heavily on leveraging private financing -->

<!-- <!-- - de texte, gros chiffres de I4CE --> -->

<!-- <!-- - **How should we fund efforts towards decarbonisation, considering the scale of investments needed ? In practice, a mix of public policy providing funding and private financing.** --> -->

<!-- ![](figures/i4ce_investneeds2.png) -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- I4CE, *Panorama des financements climats 2025* -->
<!-- - In the case of housing energy efficiency, policy typically incentivises households (via grants, preferential loans/guarantees...) to carry out improvements. -->
<!--   - In Europe especially, White Certificate schemes impose targets on energy suppliers, in terms of energy efficiency gains (which they achieve by proving support to households themselves). -->

## Green transition policies display a wide variety of overlapping instruments

- Whether **as a result of multiple market failures and/or political constraints, governments have introduced numerous overlapping policy tools**.

- See, for example, the case of energy efficiency : taxes, energy efficiency obligations, subisidies, standards, financial support, labelling & information campaigns
<!-- ![](figures/rosenow_efficiency_policymix.png) -->
<!-- (Taken from Rosenow et al., 2016) -->

- The literature is still confliced as to the effects of policy interactions :
  - The interaction between the ETS (cap-and-trade) and other policies has provoked much debate, see e.g. Perino, Ritz, van Benthem (2025)'s theoretical review. E.g. : in presence of a fixed supply of GHG allowances, mandating a shutdown of coal power plants may have 0 effects on emissions.
  - Stechemesser et al. (2019)'s ex post review of policy combinations finds that well-designed mixes are more effective.

<!-- ## Dealing with negative externalities : taxing vs subsidising behaviours -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- tribble(~"Pigovian-like Taxes", ~"Subsidies", -->
<!--         "Theoretically most efficient, achieves input subtitution and output reduction", "Not optimal, requires (distortionary) revenue-raising", -->

<!--         "Penalises inelastic consumers, arguably regressive impact", "Can be targeted to achieve redistribution, financing depends on overall progressive tax system", -->
<!--         "", "In presence of market power, subsidies may be captured by firms rather than consumers" -->
<!--         ) |>  -->
<!--   gt() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Schematically, a carbon tax or energy consumption tax would be the economist's preferred policy, while subsidies can be justified on grounds of specific market failures and/or concerns over a tax's redistributive effects. -->

<!-- - In practice, both (and many other policies, e.g. regulatory standards) are widely used by governments. -->
<!--   - Hence the interest in their **interaction**. -->
  

## Leveraging a natural experiment : how do price subsidies interact with quantity mandates ?

**We leverage a natural experiment to assess the interactions between quantity policies and an increase in subsidies for abatement** :

  - An increase in **public grants for home energy efficiency improvements**, in spring 2022.
  - This took place in the context of a pre-existing scheme which sets **home energy savings targets for energy providers**.
  - Using an event-study approach, we study the effects of this increase on private investment, improvement prices, and the number of improvements carried out.

## Evidence on public & private investment complementarity in general is limited

  - **Macro-level studies** : many macro papers study government *spending* multipliers (0.5-1, with some evidence for state-dependency), though to our knowledge only a few papers (Eden, Kray (2016) ; Abiad, Furceri, Topalova (2016)) examine public *investment* shocks.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  - **Public investment shocks** : exploit **natural experiments in public investment to show crowding-in (especially R&D)** ; effects are linked to credit frictions, i.e. SME investment is crowded-in while large firms are unresponsive or reduce investment.
  
<!-- ## Theoretical studies point to complex interactions when decarbonisation policy tools overlap -->

<!-- - In the context of green transition policies, not only is there public/private investment, but also different policy instruments for the same objective. -->


<!-- - Although research initially focused on specific choices (e.g. carbon tax vs cap-and-trade ?), there have been theoretical studies on the interactions of overlapping policy tools, especially in relation to the ETS and e.g. technical mandates. -->
<!--   - Takeaway : interactions are complex, may result in policies being substitutes or complementary. -->

## Preview of the results : extra public support may be offset by higher prices & lower private funding
- We find :
  - **Small increase in the number of improvements** carried out ;
  - **Approx 1/3 of the increase in grants offset by lower contributions from energy providers** ;
  - A majority of the increase in grants passed on to improvement prices.
  - No significant effect on households' out-of-pocket renovation expenses.

# Policy context & data

## Certificats d'Economies d'Energie : savings mandate financed by energy bills

- **The state sets 4-year targets for energy providers, in terms of energy savings**.

  - Targets are met by certificates of household energy savings. 
  
  - **Households allow firms to accumulate these certificates by signing a form, certifying that the energy supplier played an "active and incentivising" role** in carrying out energy efficiency renovations.

![](figures/CEE_vec.png)

<!-- - The state mandates energy providers to help households achieve energy savings targets (expressed in kW/h cumac), over a multi-year period. -->
<!-- - Typically, energy providers will go out and seek potential beneficiairies, or mandate private intermediaries to do so. -->
<!-- - As proof of their contributions, energy suppliers ask households to sign a formal declaration recognising that the firm made a genuine/substantial contribution to their decision to invest in efficiency improvements. -->
<!--   - There is a list of standardised improvements with associated guidelines for financial support that can be expected of the energy companies. Ultimately, however, the delivery of certificates rests on households' signatures, though some controls are carried out (?). -->

- **In practice, energy providers (or third parties) will seek out households** which may be enticed into carrying out improvements, and thus delivering certificates.


## MaPrimeRenov' : grants for house improvements targeted towards low-income households

<!-- for improvements in domestic energy efficiency. -->
<!--   - Policymakers aimed to address issues of additionality and redistribution.  -->

- MPR allows households to apply for grants for improvements to their house's energy efficiency.
  - Grants vary depending on the household's size and position relative to income quartiles
<br>
![](figures/mpr_seuilsrevenus.png)

<!-- - Redesign of the *Crédit d'Impôt pour la Transition Energétique* (CITE) : notably, the tax credit nature of the CITE limited its reach/effectiveness, and raised concerns in terms of equity as it benefited mostly households well-off enough to use the tax credit. -->

<!-- - Lump-sum subsidy defined for various types of improvements. -->
<!--   - For each improvement type, the amount is modulated according to which income group the household belongs to. -->
<!--   - E.g. : 4000 euro grant for the installation of a new heat pump, for households in the first quartile of the income distribution (3000 euros for those in the second quartile). -->
  
- **From 2020 to March 2025 : 13.9 billion euros of grants**.
  - 2.1 billion in 2021, 3.1 in 2022.
  
- **MPR may be combined with other aids, up to a maximum of 90% of the price of the improvement**.


## MPR & CEE designs create opportunities for strategic behaviour
  
<!-- revenir sur le mécanisme de crowding out classique -->


- **MPR subsidies are defined by administrative decrees, unlike CEE support which only has a floor**, but is otherwise left to the energy providers' discretion.
<br>
<br>

  - Thus, MPR's design opens the door to **strategic behaviours from energy providers**, i.e., calibrating their CEE support to households according to the amount already covered by the State through MPR.



## The CASD MPR dataset

- The MPR dataset was compiled by the Transition Ministry's statistical service, based on the internal processing system for MPR applications.

- It provides useful application-level information and link it back to records of individual improvements 
  - **each observation is thus an individual energy efficiency improvement**.
  
- **We aggregate the individual improvements in the MPR data into a panel dataset** at the *Zone d'Emploi* level (285 total ZEs in metropolitan France) and at monthly frequency.
  

# Methodology

## Identification : an increase in MPR following the invasion of Ukraine

We leverage an administrative decision, **announced mid-March 2022**, to increase the MPR subisidies for **some** types of improvements, effective on April 15 2022.

![](figures/pompili_tweet.png)

- The MPR increase was part of the French Government's Resilience strategy in the wake of the Russian invasion and subsequent energy shock.
  - The stated aim was to decrease French dependence on fossil fuels.
  
  <!-- (In fact, MPR grants for high-performance gas boilers was intended to be terminated immediately, though this was put off to 2023.) -->
  
## Estimating the effects of the MPR increase through an event study

- We examine the effects of the increase in MPR grants through an event-study framework.
  - Using an **estimator robust to heterogenenity in treatment effects (Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021)**, we study the effects of the MPR change 5 months before/after it was effective.
  
As our treatment variable is binary (= 1 if the improvement type is concerned by the MPR increase and the date is 15/04/2022 or after), the estimation is similar to, but more robust than, the canonical DiD TWFE regression :

$$Y_{i,t}=\alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{k = -5; }^{5} \gamma_k*D_{i,t-k} + \beta*X_{i,t}$$
  

- At this stage, **we are limited in terms of specification choice by the amount of variables available in the CASD dataset**. We control for :

  - Median fiscal revenue ;
  - Share of MPR applicants that are homeowners.
  
  
<!-- as well as the  to control for potential product differentiation and agent-principal issues. -->
<!-- <!-- [On pourrait ajouter les variables relatives aux DPE, si elles sont bien renseignées..



<!-- - Si dispo: séries temp des prix de gestes. -->
<!-- - Distributions pre/post des variables d'outcome [graphs]. -->



## Sample & treated/control group selection

- We focus on the lowest income category : i.e. those most likely to be "activated" by the subsidies. 

- We focus on discrete improvements rather than insulation works, as the former make for more intuitive comparison groups.

<!-- [soit on justifie davantage en suivant cet argument, soit on élargit le champ de l'étude à toutes les catégories de revenus.] -->

- The treated group could include, in theory, all types of improvements which were concerned by the MPR increase of April 2022. 
  - Thus far : we focus on heat pumps as our treated group, which are the improvement type which 1) benefited from the MPR increase 2) has the highest number of observations.
  
- The control group includes improvements which were not concerned by the MPR increase.
  - **We further exclude high performance gas boilers due to the trend in gas prices and explicit policy of reducing their usage**.

<!-- [En pratique, on s'est limité pour l'instant aux PAC pour limiter le nombre d'estimations à faire/ c'est ce qui donne le groupe traité avec N le plus élevé..] -->

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

- A combination of private and public financing is the default strategy for governments to meet pressing investment needs.

- Furthermore, in the context of green transition efforts, there are overlaps of policy instruments.
  - E.g. : quantity & price instruments.
  - The evidence on the effects of these interacting policies is limited thus far.
  
- Our contribution is to leverage a natural experiment to provide some evidence on how quantity/price policies interact.
  - In the case of MPR and CEE, our results suggest that the increase in subsidies partly displaced  private funding resulting from the quantity mandate.
  
## Extensions

As this work is still preliminary, there are many avenues for further research :

- Performing the same estimates for other household income levels and/or improvement types
- Examining the price effect : is it an increase in profit margins ? (of heat pump installers ? or makers ?)
- Modelising the strategic interactions that lead to the crowding-out effect.

## MPR and CEE are cumulative, but only up to a point

  - **The sum of MPR and CEE may not exceed a share of the total cost of the improvement (from 60% to 90%)**.
  
  <br>

  - Depending on the generosity of MPR and CEE, this may "mechanically" introduce substitution effects between MPR and CEE.

## Distribution des seuils d'écrêtement

- Rappel : la somme des primes MPR + CEE ne peut pas dépasser 90% du prix TTC.
  <!-- - Pour les PAC, sur les 5 mois avant la modification de MPR, environ 30% des installations étaient à moins de 1000 euros du seuil. -->
  - **Sur la période pré-intervention, parmi les travaux où le cumul des aides impliquant un reste à charge <1000 euros, l'écart entre le seuil d'écrètement et le cumul des aides était de 349 euros en moyenne.**
